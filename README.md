# RedwoodJS Components

This is currently a PoC of using TailwindCSS to create a branding system for bespoke RedwoodJS specific components.

View existing components by building this repo and running `yarn rw storybook`.

Alternatively, this Storybook has been published on Chromatic [here](https://6525bb94aba230a3c956f05b-ogxkhkrtib.chromatic.com/).

NOTE: We haven't yet removed the API side, but it is not in use. There have also been no pages added - this PoC is currently Storybook only.
