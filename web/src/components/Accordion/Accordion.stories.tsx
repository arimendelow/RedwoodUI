      <AccordionItem value="item-1">
        <AccordionTrigger>Is it accessible?</AccordionTrigger>
        <AccordionContent>
          Yes. It adheres to the WAI-ARIA design pattern, as it's built with Radix UI.
        </AccordionContent>
      </AccordionItem>
      <AccordionItem value="item-2">
        <AccordionTrigger>Is it styled?</AccordionTrigger>
        <AccordionContent>
          Yes! It matches all other components, including built-in dark mode support ðŸ˜‰
        </AccordionContent>
      </AccordionItem>
      <AccordionItem value="item-3">
        <AccordionTrigger>Is it animated?</AccordionTrigger>
        <AccordionContent>
          Yes, with CSS - but you can disable it if you
          prefer. If you're interested in instead animating with Framer Motion, refer to the docs for why we didn't do that.
        </AccordionContent>
      </AccordionItem>
    </Accordion>
